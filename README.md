# Matplotlib Plot Examples
This repository contains examples of various types of plots created using Matplotlib, a powerful plotting library in Python. Below is a brief description of each type of plot included in this repository:

# Line Plot
Line plots display information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments. They are useful for visualizing trends over a continuous range.

# Multiple Lines in One Plot
Multiple line plots can be displayed in a single graph to compare different datasets. Each line represents a different dataset, allowing for easy comparison.

# Bar Graph
Bar graphs represent data with rectangular bars. The length of each bar is proportional to the value it represents. This repository includes both vertical and horizontal bar graphs.

# Scatter Plot
Scatter plots display individual data points on a horizontal and vertical axis. They show how one variable is affected by another and are useful for identifying correlations.

# Pie Chart
Pie charts represent data as slices of a pie, showing the proportion of different categories within a whole. They are useful for visualizing relative sizes of data segments.

# Histogram
Histograms represent the distribution of numerical data by splitting it into bins and counting the number of data points in each bin. They provide insights into data distribution and variability.

# Box Plot
Box plots, or whisker plots, summarize the distribution of data based on a five-number summary: minimum, first quartile (Q1), median, third quartile (Q3), and maximum. They are useful for identifying outliers and understanding data dispersion.

# Subplots
Subplots allow for multiple plots to be displayed within a single figure, making it easy to compare different visualizations side by side.

# Sine Waves
Sine wave plots visualize periodic oscillations. They are particularly useful for representing waveforms in various scientific and engineering applications.

# Sine and Cosine Waves with Subplots
This repository also includes examples of plotting sine and cosine waves together using subplots, providing a comparative view of these periodic functions.
